# KECPA Website — Architecture

## Stack
Existing static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite; native CSS 3D transforms and lightweight requestAnimationFrame scroll effects.

## System boundaries
- Static HTML retains all business content and SEO. index.css owns the visual system; script.js owns navigation, motion and existing form handling.
- CSS transform-style: preserve-3d renders the growth sculpture without a graphics dependency. One scheduled animation frame batches geometry reads before numeric style writes. No continuous idle loop or scroll hijacking.
- Vite builds the same entry point; existing Cloudflare Worker remains the production boundary. .assetsignore excludes internal docs and test artifacts from root-directory assets.
- Existing external services: Google Fonts, Font Awesome CSS/fonts, hits.sh visitor badge and Formspree contact submission.
- Formspree is the remote input boundary. No local backend, authentication, database or file upload exists.

## Data classification
- Website copy and graphics are public. Contact name, email, phone and message are personal data sent to the existing Formspree endpoint only on user submission.
- localStorage contains only a submission timestamp; a memory fallback handles denied storage. No financial records or API credentials are introduced.
- Remote Formspree retention is controlled by the existing account, not by this frontend.

## Security architecture
- Existing HTTPS, CSP, frame and referrer headers remain intact. Client form validation, honeypot and best-effort cooldown retained; server enforcement remains the provider's responsibility.
- Motion has no user-provided strings, eval, network calls or HTML sinks. Errors use textContent; button HTML is fixed text.
- QA uses fictional form data and intercepts every Formspree request. Script accepts a locally installed Playwright through PLAYWRIGHT_PATH.
